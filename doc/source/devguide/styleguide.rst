Style Guidelines
================

.. important:: To ensure consistent styling with little effort, this project
    uses `clang-format <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>`_. The
    repository contains a ``.clang-format`` file that can be used to
    automatically apply the style rules that are described below. The easiest
    way to use clang-format is through a plugin/extension for your editor/IDE
    that automatically runs clang-format using the ``.clang-format`` file
    whenever a file is saved.

Follow the `C++ Core Guidelines
<http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines>`_ except when they
conflict with another guideline listed here.

Conform to the C++14 standard.

Indentation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use two spaces per indentation level.

Source Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a ``.cpp`` suffix for code files and ``.h`` for header files.

Header files should always use include guards with the following style (See
`SF.8 <http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#sf8-use-include-guards-for-all-h-files>`_):

.. code-block:: C++

    #ifndef ENRICO_MODULE_NAME_H
    #define ENRICO_MODULE_NAME_H

    namespace enrico {
    ...
    content
    ...
    }

    #endif // ENRICO_MODULE_NAME_H

Avoid hidden dependencies by always including a related header file first,
followed by local includes, other library includes, and then C/C++ library
includes. For example:

.. code-block:: C++

   // foo.cpp
   #include "foo.h"

   #include "bar.h"
   #include "baz.h"

   #include <gsl/gsl>

   #include <cstddef>
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>

Naming
~~~~~~

Struct and class names should be CamelCase, e.g. ``HexLattice``.

Functions (including member functions) should be lower-case with underscores,
e.g. ``get_indices``.

Local variables, global variables, and struct/class member variables should be
lower-case with underscores, except for physics symbols that are written
differently by convention (e.g., ``E`` for energy). Data members of classes
additionally have trailing underscores (e.g., ``a_class_member_``).

All classes and non-member functions should be declared within the ``enrico``
namespace.

Accessors and mutators (get and set functions) may be named like
variables. These often correspond to actual member variables, but this is not
required. For example, ``int count()`` and ``void set_count(int count)``.

Variables declared constexpr or const that have static storage duration (exist
for the duration of the program) should be upper-case with underscores,
e.g., ``SQRT_PI``.

Use C++-style declarator layout (see `NL.18
<http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#nl18-use-c-style-declarator-layout>`_):
pointer and reference operators in declarations should be placed adjacent to the
base type rather than the variable name. Avoid declaring multiple names in a
single declaration to avoid confusion:

.. code-block:: C++

   T* p; // good
   T& p; // good
   T *p; // bad
   T* p, q; // misleading

Source Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Classes, structs, and functions are to be annotated for the `Doxygen
<http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_ documentation generation tool. Use the
``\`` form of Doxygen commands, e.g., ``\brief`` instead of ``@brief``.
